* Make a hosts file like

  $ cat hosts
  [all]
  192.168.10.1

* run (example): initialize (mainly add the first user).

  The script creates a new user whose name can be given by 'user_name' variable.

  - When you can login as ubuntu who can be root by sudo.

  $ ansible-playbook -i hosts initialize.yaml [--extra-vars user=$USER] -u ubuntu -k -K -b

    -k: Ask password to login
    -K: Ask password for sudo.
        So it can be omitted if the user (ubuntu in the above) becomes root w/o password.
    -b: Run with sudo

  - When you can login as root with a password.

  $ ansible-playbook -i hosts initialize.yaml --extra-vars user=user_name -u root -k

* run: setup home directory

  $ ansible-playbook -i hosts setup-home.yaml

# An example for localhost

    $ ansible-playbook -i local, -c local misc/blade/setup-by-ansible/setup-home.yaml


# When there's only python3 on the target host, the following option should be added.

    -e 'ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3'
