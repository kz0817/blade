* Make a hosts file like

  $ cat hosts
  [all]
  192.168.10.1

* run (example): initialize (mainly add the first user).

  The script creates a new user whose name can be given by 'user_name' variable.

  - When you can login as ubuntu who can be root by sudo.

  $ ansible-playbook -i hosts initialize.yaml --extra-vars user=user_name -u ubuntu -s -K

    -K can be omitted if the user (ubuntu in the above) can be root w/o password.

  - When you can login as root with a password.

  $ ansible-playbook -i hosts initialize.yaml --extra-vars user=user_name -u root -k

* run: setup home directory

  $ ansible-playbook -i hosts setup-home.yaml

* Note
The following packages shall be installed before the above run.

Some matter in .bashrc inserts escape sequences and makes it fail sometimes.
In such case, change the TERM environment like,

  $ TERM=xterm ansible-playbook -i hosts setup-home.yaml

- python
- git
